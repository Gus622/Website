                    <p>Computer, Cyber or information technology security  is the protection of computer systems from theft ( the action or crime of stealing) or damage to software or electronic data.</p>
                    <p>Physical security refers to limiting access to key computer resources by keeping the resources behind a locked door and protected from natural and human-made disasters. Physical security can protect a computer(hardware) from misuse by unqualified employees. It can also protect the computer(hardware) from hackers. </p>
                    <p>Depending on the level of protection,  physical security can also protect resources from natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes.</p>
                    <p>Physical security should be installed to protect core routers, servers and  backup storage etc 
Because physical security is such an obvious requirement, it is easy to forget to plan for it. 
So kids don’t forget.

                    <p>Setting up Two-factor authentication on your accounts should always be done to prevent hackers from gaining access to your accounts. It provides an additional layer of security that can help defend your information in case your passwords become vulnerable.
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a second layer of security that you, and only you, can access in order to log into an account. Usually, this extra layer is used when accessing your account from an unknown location. Most services provide this extra option but you may have to turn it on, in order to do this you should access the setting in your security settings, however, if you are unable to find these settings you can use this site to access it on most popular sites. Methods of 2FA include authenticator apps, backup codes sent to an email address that can only be used once, texts and phone calls.

                    <p>When shopping online you should always be careful of the sites you use as malicious sites can and will steal payment information, your address and other important information. In order to prevent this, there are a few tips that can keep you safe.</p>
                    <p> You may notice a small padlock; this is a good sign but it does not guarantee safety. This means the connection is encrypted so any information you send cannot be intercepted by a 3rd party but that does not mean the site you use won’t steal it.</p>
                    <p>Research the sites you use to shop in order to avoid using an unsafe site.</p>
                    <p>Use either a credit card or a trusted service such as PayPal to buy online, these ensure online purchases or allow you to cancel/ chargeback on payments you have made.</p>
                    <p>Don’t give out too much information to sites, such your mothers maiden name, primary school name or first pets name, only fill in the required boxes.</p>
                    <p>Use strong passwords and use a password manager to ensure your shopping accounts are not stolen (link to tips page) Use this resource to ensure you are being as safe as possible with your accounts</p>
                    <p>Be careful with links you receive in emails and texts, the may not be safe and could be from scam accounts. They could lead to a fake site intended to steal login information so you should only ever access trusted sites either from the URL or via a search engine such as Google or Bing.</p>

                    <p>Even following the tips on this website there is a chance that your account could be compromised, in this case, you should follow the tips on this page to get your account back. First of all, you should update your devices to ensure security, the OS and apps should always be kept up to date. In order to refrain control of your account you should firstly contact the provider, go to the homepage of the site in question and find the help/ support page which will detail the steps for account recovery, in the case this is not possible use a provided support channel to speak to an employee.</p>
                    <p>In the case of it being your email that has been hacked, check the filters and forwarding rules of the account, a common tactic for hackers is to use these to forward your information to their own accounts to gain access to any and all information sent to your account even after they lose access.</p>
                    <p>Change your passwords as soon as you regain access to the account, and not just the hacked account as your other passwords may be vulnerable to hacking too.</p>
                    <p>Set up Two Factor Authorisation if you have not already done so(link to the page on 2FA).</p>
                    <p>In the event you are unable to regain control of your lost account, should you create another ensure that you contact all contacts in order to notify them of any changed contact details.</p>
