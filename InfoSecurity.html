                    <p>Phishing attacks are where scammers send fake emails to people with the goal of gaining access to sensitive information, get people to send money etc. In order to avoid falling victim to these attacks you should follow these Guidelines for both users and Companies.
in terms of users themselves you should never send sensitive information or trust any email from an unknown source asking for money, most email providers will automatically filter out phishing and other scam emails but there are some that will make it through.</p><p>
Companies will normally Have layers of protection that prevent this, firstly they will make sure that users on their network are given appropriate privileges for their job. They are given the lowest possible privileges required to perform their jobs so that if a user does fall victim to a phishing or other attack the damage is minimized. only System admins should be given admin privileges that allow them to install software, make changes that affect other users and create accounts on the network. these privileges should only ever be given to IT professionals, while it restricts employees it ensures the network is secure.
Databases for companies should also always be encrypted as they deal with large amounts of sensitive data, that if it became compromised would result in customers, users and the company itself’s data being stolen.
